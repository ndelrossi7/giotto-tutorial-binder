# Giotto Training Binder

In this Binder, you'll be able to look through and practice the different methods and functionalities of [Giotto](https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/index.html). The notebooks typically correspond to the code referenced in the [HOWTO](https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/articles/getting_started.html#howtos) section. 

When launching Binder, this will take some time as the environment gets set up and downloads all the necessary dependencies. You'll also notice that there are a number of scripts that are imported in the more advanced notebooks. The purpose of this is to avoid re-hashing the main ideas but the scripts themselves are well commented so that you can go through them to see how the Giotto object is created + what the pre-processing steps are.
